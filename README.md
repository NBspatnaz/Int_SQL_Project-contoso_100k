# INTERMEDIATE SQL - SALES ANALYSIS

## Overview
This project is based on the Contoso database of Luke Barousse that is uploaded and available on Github. As this is a self taught Intermediate SQL course under that focused on analyzing the different sales aspect of an e-commerce business called contoso. Although this project was learned and followed Luke Barousse's teaching the execution of the queries followed some different approach to solve the question rather than blindly follow the intstrustion.

## Business Questions
With this database I tend to find out the following question 
 1. **Customer Segmentation**: How to divied the customer into different segment based on their average life-time value(LTV)? 
 2. **Cohort Analysis**: How much customer revenue generated by different customer cohort?
 3. **Customer Retention**
